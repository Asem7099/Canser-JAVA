# Canser-JAVA
A simple program to know the type of cancer that the patient suffers from

First, the user enters his data, and this data is saved in a file so that each patient has a separate file.
The patient is asked several questions, and based on his answers, the type of cancer is determined if it is blood, lung, or colon cancer,
the best place for treatment, and the approximate cost of treatment.
